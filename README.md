# Temple-of-Quack
 
### Inspiration
We were inspired by other dungeon crawler video games and thought we 'd try our hands on making our very own with unique flavours and twist.

### What it does
It's a shoot-em-up dungeon crawler game where you play as a duck and throw sharp feathers at evil geese with knives and guns. There's also a miniboss for you to fight in this demo.

### How we built it
Unity.

### Challenges we ran into
We had a few trouble with getting the bullets and feathers to trigger OnCollisionEnter when it hit other objects. The 2D physics interaction between the player and AI is also a bit janky.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have a workable demo which is actually kind of fun to play with. The artist of the game also likes the sprites they drew.

### What we learned
We learnt a lot about the Unity engine in general, particularly those features that are needed for a 2D dungeon crawler.

### What's next for Temple of Quack
If the team wants, there are a lot of untapped opportunities for Temple of Quack, such as implementing a shop system, giving player power-ups, tougher bosses deep down the dungeon, and the sweet lore about the Feather Wars everyone wants to hear about.
